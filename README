# Docker

## Building the Image
We can quickly build the Docker image with:
```
docker build <IMAGE_NAME> <DOCKERFILE_LOCATION>
```
We can also add `--progress plain` to see the outputs or `--no-cache` to build with no cache. 

## Running the Container
To test the image before we send it to the registry:
```
docker run -it --rm -p 80:80  --name test testo
```
Also in order to modify the launch configuration we can enter environments such as `-e ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development` and `-e ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://localhost:5001/`.

## Uploading the Image to Docker Hub
After getting an account from Docker Hub, we should login to their registry with `docker login`. Afterwards:
```
docker tag <IMAGE_NAME>:<TAG> <REGISTRY_REPO_ADDRESS>:<TAG>
docker push <REGISTRY_REPO_ADDRESS>:<TAG>
```

# Kubernetes
All configs are under `k8s-configs/` folder. There is also a script to make the deployment.
