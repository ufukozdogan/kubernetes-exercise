# Building the Docker Image and Running the Docker Container

## Build
We can quickly build the Docker image with:
```
docker build <IMAGE_NAME> <DOCKERFILE_LOCATION>
```
We can also add `--progress plain` to see the outputs or `--no-cache` to build with no cache. 

## Run
In order to run the image:
```
docker run -it --rm -p 80:80  --name test testo
```
Also in order to modify the environments we can enter environments such as `-e ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Development` and `-e ASPNETCORE_URLS=http://localhost:5001/`.
